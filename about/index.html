                <p>
                    Hi! My name is Marie Holme Kjær, and I'm a graphic designer based in Kristiansand. I enjoy spending time with my husband and pets, playing video games, and playing trumpet in Søgne Musikkorps.
                </p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I am currently studying Graphic Design online at Noroff, after completing my first year on campus in Kristiansand. I initially started a bachelor's in Web Development at NTNU Gjøvik, but found myself more drawn to the graphic side of websites. I completed most of the bachelor's program at NTNU before switching to Graphic Design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During my studies at Noroff, I've explored different design styles to develop my skills and experimented wherever I can. I have experience in areas such as packaging and labeling, printed media like posters and folders, brand development, website design, social media content, and photography. I like to adapt my design to the needs of each project, keeping things clear and consistent while experimenting with creative details. I also enjoy trying out new styles, tools, and techniques to see what works best for each project.
                </p>

                <p>
                    During my web development studies, I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and back-end development. I also took classes in project management, information structures and database systems, information architecture, and cloud technologies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have coded this portfolio website from scratch to reflect my background in both Web Development and Graphic design.
